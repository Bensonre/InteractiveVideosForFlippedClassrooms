# Senior Capstone Interactive Video For Flipped Classroom
### By Reese Benson, Devin Sather, and Timothy O'Rourke
 
## Overview
Our goal is to create an Interactive platform for students to be able to answer questions during lecture or supplemental video content that is released by their professor. The Professors conversely should be able to upload videos, create questions and assign those questions to time stamps within the video. This Repository and project is simply a demo or Code Spike in that process. This is the proof of concept that will later be implemented in the pre-existing System Concept Warehouse. Concept Warehouse is an online tool designed to:
-Share your experiences and contribute to the community
-Find, create, and share conceptual questions
-Collect student answers in a variety of ways
-Visualize results for class use and education research.
 
## Scope
Due to the fact we are simply a proof of concept our scope is more limited than it may appear our task in only the creation of questions, the insertion of said questions into videos, the upload of videos, and the ability for students to answer questions.
